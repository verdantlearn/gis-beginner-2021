> Welcome to this short beginner course on GIS for wildlife conservationists!

Many of the materials on this course were created as Lucy Tallents' commitment to [Open Education for a Better World](https://oe4bw.org) 2021.  The materials have been updated for a paid course running from **Monday 22 November to Sunday 19 December 2021**

Each week contains a range of activities that should take you 4-5 hours to complete, including:
- Discussion
- Hands-on GIS exercises
- Reading and reflection
- Mini assignments

Each module's pages will be published on the Friday before the module begins

If you complete all of the assignments, you will be eligible for a certificate of course completion
