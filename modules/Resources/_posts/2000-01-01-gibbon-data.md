# Datasets for the gibbon case study

If you don't have field data of your own to work with, you can use our example dataset on black crested gibbon surveys.  These datasets can also be downloaded from the course pages where they first appear, but we've gathered them together here for your convenience

Clicking on the links to *.zip* files should open a 'Download' pop-up in your browser, asking you where to save the file.  Other links take you to websites where you download data directly
