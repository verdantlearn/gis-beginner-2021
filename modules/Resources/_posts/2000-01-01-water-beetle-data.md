# Water beetles dataset

If you don't have field data of your own, you can use an example dataset on water beetles in Northern Ireland, collected by the Balfour-Browne Club over more than a century

These data are a subset of the openly-licenced water beetle survey data from the UK's [National Biodiversity Network Atlas](https://registry.nbnatlas.org/public/showDataResource/dr686), DOI: https://doi.org/10.15468/npcgrp

You can download the survey data here:
