# Water beetles dataset

If you don't have field data of your own, you can use an example dataset on water beetles in Northern Ireland.  These data are a subset of the openly-licenced water beetle survey data from the UK's [National Biodiversity Network Atlas](https://registry.nbnatlas.org/public/showDataResource/dr686)

You can download the survey data here:
- [GPS locations](https://github.com/verdantlearn/gis-refresher-gps-field-obs/blob/master/datasets/waterbeetles_wpts.gpx) as .gpx file
- [Field observations](https://github.com/verdantlearn/gis-refresher-gps-field-obs/blob/master/datasets/waterbeetles_fieldobs.csv) as .csv file
