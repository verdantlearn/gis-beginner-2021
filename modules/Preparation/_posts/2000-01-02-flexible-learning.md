## Flexible learning

This beginner course *Introducing GIS for conservation* will run for four weeks, from Monday 17th to Friday 21st May 2021

The learning activities should take you 4-5 hours of effort each week

- The **timing** of activities is *flexible*, so you can choose when to study
- You could study for 45-60 minutes every weekday, or complete all the activities in a single day
- We recommend that you **spread your learning** over several days, so that you benefit from input and feedback from other participants, but it's your choice!
