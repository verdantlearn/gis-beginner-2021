## Community forum

We invite you to join [VerdantLearn's community discussion forum](https://community.verdantlearn.org), which is where our collaborative learning happens

The community forum is public, so you will be able to read other people's posts without signing in.  However, you will need to **create an account** if you want to:
- Discuss what you're learning on this course

- Report errors or make suggestions for improvement
- Submit course assignments
- Be eligible for a certificate of course completion
