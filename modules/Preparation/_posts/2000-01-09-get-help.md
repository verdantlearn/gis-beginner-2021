## Where to get help
If you're struggling with any of the exercises, request assistance in the [Learn GIS category of VerdantLearn's community forum](https://community.verdantlearn.org/tags/c/learn/gis/12/help-needed), tagged with `help-needed`:
1. Create a new topic (you'll need to sign in first)
2. If your topic is marked as `Uncategorized`, change its category to `Learn` and `GIS`
3. Select the `help-needed` tag to alert everyone that you're stuck

If you're studying on a MOOC or paid course, your tutor will check the `help-needed` page several times each week, but you may also get support from your peers.  We ask those of you who are confident doing the tasks take a moment to help others in our learning community, so we can all move forward together.  Thank you!

If you're not sure what you should be doing at any point, you can also post a question on the community forum tagged with `help-needed` and we will clarify
