## Flexible learning

The learning activities on this 4-week part-time course should take you 4-5 hours of effort each week.  Alternatively, if you are self-studying the course, you might choose to study full-time over several days, or on another schedule to suit yourself

- The **timing** of activities is *flexible*, so you can choose when to study
- You could study for 45-60 minutes every weekday, or complete all the activities in a single day
- We recommend that you **spread your learning** over several days, so that you benefit from input and feedback from other participants, but it's your choice!
