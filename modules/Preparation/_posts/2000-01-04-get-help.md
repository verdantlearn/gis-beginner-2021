## Where to get help
If you're struggling with any of the tasks, the first place to post is in the **Help Forum** :raised_hand: for this GIS course, which you can find on [VerdantLearn's community discussion forum](https://community.verdantlearn.org), embedded below

Your tutor will check the help forum several times each week, but you may also get support from your peers.  We ask that those of you who are confident doing the tasks check this page occasionally, to help our learning community all move forward together.  Thank you!

If you're not sure what you should be doing at any point, you can also post a question there and we will clarify

    (function() { 
        var d = document.createElement('script'); d.type = 'text/javascript'; 
        d.async = true; d.src = window.DiscourseEmbed.discourseUrl + 'javascripts/embed.js'; 
        (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(d); 
    })();
