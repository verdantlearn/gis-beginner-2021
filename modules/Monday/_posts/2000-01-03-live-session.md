We'll use the same Zoom link for **all** live sessions this week: [https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82834870945?pwd=RDdYczVIZHlWdk4yN3B2dUJxMk9jdz09](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/82834870945?pwd=RDdYczVIZHlWdk4yN3B2dUJxMk9jdz09)

During your chosen live session, we will work together to complete all of the learning activities for today

If you're not able to join either of the live sessions, you can work solo to contribute your ideas to the collaborative documents.  You'll find links to these on the following pages
