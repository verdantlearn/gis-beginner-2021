## Your field data
*15 minutes*, included in the live session if you attend

Tell us about the field data that you're working with!

Add a post describing your project, by clicking the pink `+` button in the embedded Padlet below.  Include the following information:
- Your **name**
- What is the **purpose** of your fieldwork?  What are you monitoring or researching, and why?
- What **field observations** have you been recording?
- How are the **locations** recorded?  On paper, using a GPS, in a spreadsheet or smartphone app?
- Once your field observations are in your GIS software, **what will you do with them**?

If you don't have your own field data yet, describe a project that you would like to do in the future, or something you have worked on in the past

You may find it easier to *draft your message* in Word or a text editor before pasting it into the Padlet
