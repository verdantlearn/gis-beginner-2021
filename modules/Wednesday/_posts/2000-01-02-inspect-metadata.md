## Inspect the metadata
*15 minutes*

Out of all the datasets you're now aware of, **choose one** that shows promise to fulfil your needs

Investigate your chosen dataset's `metadata` - the detailed information about the dataset, which may include:
- What **type of observations** the dataset contains
- Any **codes** or lookup tables that indicate what the data values represent
- **When** and **where** the data were collected
- **How** they were collected (what instruments or survey methods were used), and by whom
- How often the area is **resurveyed**
