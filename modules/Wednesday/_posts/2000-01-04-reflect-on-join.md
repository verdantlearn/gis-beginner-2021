## Reflect on your progress
*5 minutes*

Take a few minutes to **reflect** on what you've learned so far
1. What is the most useful thing you've learned so far?
2. What is your biggest remaining question at this point?
3. How can you use these skills in your own GIS work?

Here's an extra (optional) **technical question** to strengthen your learning:
- What would have happened if we had joined the two layers *the other way around*, with the field observations as the source and the waypoints layer as the destination?  Feel free to try it out to practice, and clarify the process of joining datasets in your head!
