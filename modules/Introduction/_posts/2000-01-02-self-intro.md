### Introduce yourself!

Hello :wave: it's lovely to meet you!  Now that you've found your way to this course, why not announce your arrival to our learning community?

If you haven't already created an account at [https://community.verdantlearn.org](https://community.verdantlearn.org), you'll need to do that first.  See the *Community forum* page in the Preparation module for instructions on how to sign up and create your profile

**Post a self-introduction** by replying to Lucy's post below, or as a new topic in the Learn > GIS category if you prefer

Once you've introduced yourself, read through other people's self-introductions and reply to someone to make connections and reward them for their effort.  Try to **find a fellow learner** with whom you have something in common - you can use the Discourse search function (top-right of any community page) to search for a keyword e.g. species name, organisation, country


<div id='discourse-comments'></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  window.DiscourseEmbed = { discourseUrl: 'https://community.verdantlearn.org/', topicId: 23 };

  (function() {
    var d = document.createElement('script'); d.type = 'text/javascript'; d.async = true;
    d.src = window.DiscourseEmbed.discourseUrl + 'javascripts/embed.js';
    (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(d);
  })();
</script>
