## Case study

Throughout this course, we encourage you to use your own datasets so you can immediately apply what you're learning.  However, we know that sometimes it's easier to start with a simplified dataset that matches what other learners are using, so we provide data from a case-study

We're going to work with field data from surveys of the Critically Endangered western black crested gibbon, *Nomascus concolor* from Chế Tạo Nature Reserve in northern Viet Nam

Western black crested gibbon pair[^1]


Gibbons are arboreal apes dependent on continuous forest canopy.  They live in monogamous family groups composed of a breeding pair and usually 1-2 infants/juveniles.  This particular species was thought to be extinct in Viet Nam until it was rediscovered in 2000.  See the [IUCN Redlist page on black-crested gibbons](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/39775/17968556) for more information on their ecology and conservation.

You can download the boundary of the Chế Tạo Nature Reserve from Protected Planet: https://www.protectedplanet.net/555594126


go to
[www.naturalearthdata.com](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/) for
background information on the data layers. You are going to open up a
new, empty project in QGIS, and add a ready-made data layer of countries
across the globe. You can find instructions for this practical activity
in the QGIS first steps guide.
