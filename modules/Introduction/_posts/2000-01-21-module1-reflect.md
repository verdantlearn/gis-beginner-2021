Congratulations!  You've just taken you first steps to creating a GIS project, and discovering the power of visualising spatial data  :star:

## Reflect on your progress

Take a few minutes to **reflect** on what you've learned this week
1. What is the *most useful* thing you've learned so far?
2. What is your biggest *remaining question* at this point?

<NEEDS WORK!> Airtable needs updating to include source of reflection (course and module)
