## Case study: Black crested gibbons

Throughout this course, we encourage you to *use your own field data* so you can immediately apply what you're learning.  However, we know that it can be easier to start with a simplified dataset that matches what other learners are using, so we also provide data from a case-study of the Critically Endangered western black crested gibbon, *Nomascus concolor* in Chế Tạo Nature Reserve in northern Vietnam

Gibbons are arboreal apes dependent on continuous forest canopy.  They live in monogamous family groups composed of a breeding pair and usually 1-2 infants/juveniles.  *Nomascus concolor* was thought to be extinct in Vietnam until it was rediscovered in 2000.  See the [IUCN Redlist page on black-crested gibbons](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/39775/17968556) for more information on their ecology and conservation.

### Your first QGIS project
Let's start your first QGIS project!  We'll add gibbon sightings from our survey, and distribution information from the IUCN Redlist record for this species[^2]

First you'll need to **download** the gibbon sightings.  Clicking on the links below will either open a 'Download' pop-up in your browser, asking you where to save the files, or automatically download them to the usual location on your computer, depending on your web browser settings
> 1. First create a new folder for your first GIS project, ready to store the gibbon sightings
1. Download <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/src/datasets/NomascusConcolor_Distribution.zip" download>NomascusConcolor_Distribution.zip</a>
2. Unzip the gibbon distribution files into your folder
3. Download <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/src/datasets/GibbonSightings_Survey1.geojson" download>GibbonSightings_Survey1.geojson</a>  

Note how the two datasets are in different file formats.  The gibbon sightings are a single *.geojson* file, while the species distribution dataset is an ESRI shapefile, composed of many separate files with different file extensions: *.shp*, *.dbf* etc

Let's **add the distribution data** to QGIS:
> 1. In QGIS, click on the `Layer menu > Add Layer > Add Vector Layer...`
1. Choose the source file by clicking the [...] button and finding *NomascusConcolor_Distribution**.shp*** - note that it's the file ending in *.SHP* that you need to add to QGIS.  You should see some  

Now we'll **add the gibbon sightings**:
> 1. Repeat the same process using `Add Vector Layer...` to add *GibbonSightings_Survey1.geojson*
2. Click Add and Close.  You should see the points clustered in the right-hand polygon on your QGIS map view - we'll zoom in and inspect them shortly
3. Save your project in the same folder as the gibbon sightings file: `Project > Save`

Your new project should look like this:
