## Introduction
Welcome to Module 1 of 'Introducing GIS for conservation'.  We're so pleased to have you here!  :green_heart: 

In this module, you'll take your first steps in using QGIS, including adding data to a new project and managing how layers are displayed.  You will also decide a specific learning goal that you want to achieve by the end of the course

### Learning objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Describe how you want to use GIS to support your own conservation work
- Distinguish between GIS projects, layers and spatial data
- Create a GIS project
- Add layers to your project and manage their display order
- View a layerâ€™s properties
- View a layer's attributes table
- Use the Identify tool to view a feature's attributes

Before we open QGIS, let's get to know each other  :smiley:  Go to the next page to introduce yourself to the other conservationists on this course
