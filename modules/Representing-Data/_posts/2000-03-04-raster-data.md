## Raster data model

The raster data model is best for modeling features that vary in a continuous way across the landscape.

Examples of raster features:
- Soil or vegetation type
- Plant density
- Salinity
- Vegetation productivity
- Carbon sequestration

The invention of remote-sensing, from photography to radar and satellite imagery, has caused an explosion in our ability to record data continuously across a landscape.  However, we often still collect samples at point locations, for example rainfall at weather stations, or vegetation height in quadrats.  This means that some types of field data, whilst collected from a spatial continuum, may still be represented in vector format

  A raster is composed of a matrix of contiguous cells, with each cell (pixel) holding a single numeric value.

Grid cell = pixel
