## Vector data model

The vector data model is best for modeling discrete features: objects that have clearly defined boundaries, which it would be possible to count

Examples of vector features:
- Coral reefs
- Point sources of pollution
- Individual trees or patches of wetland
- Animal movement tracks from GPS collars
- Areas affected by fire or clear-felling

Vector data come in three forms: point, line and polygon.

Points
: One-dimensional feature with a single x and y coordinate
This example contains 3 points

Lines
: Linear two dimensional feature composed of a series of x and y coordinates  

This example contains a single line

Polygons
: Two dimensional feature composed of sequence of x and y coordinates where the first and last coordinates are identical, creating a closed area  

This example contains a single polygon
