## Representing your data: Which model works best?

> <NEEDS WORK!>

What data do you collect in the field?  What kinds of data have you worked with in the past?






What is the best data model for your own data?  Is this an easy or a difficult decision?  Is there any ambiguity about which data model (raster, vector, or another) you should choose?

Share your examples of vector/raster datasets in the discussion topic below, plus any questions you may have
