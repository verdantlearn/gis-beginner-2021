## Introduction
Welcome to Module 2 of 'Introducing GIS for conservation'

In this module, we'll discover the difference between vector and raster data, discuss which of these data models is appropriate for your own field data, and consider sources of geospatial uncertainty

### Learning objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Describe raster and vector data models
- Give examples of vector and raster in your own work
- Justify the choice of data model for a given dataset
- Suggest sources of uncertainty in geospatial data
- Adjust the symbology of vector layers
- Define resolution and extent in geospatial terms

*[vector]: Discrete points, lines or polygons
*[raster]: Continuous grid or image
