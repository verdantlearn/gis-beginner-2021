## Module 2 assignment

You need to submit *every* assignment to qualify for a certificate of completion.
Each assignment includes three parts:
1. **Evidence** :information_source: - A screenshot of QGIS showing your progress
2. **Reflection** :thought_balloon: - A paragraph describing your experience of the learning activities on this module
3. **Peer feedback** :speech_balloon: - A comment on someone else's assignment

### Prepare your assignment

1. Save a **screenshot** of your QGIS project after the final exercise - *this is your Evidence* :information_source:  You can use the case study datasets, or your own field data
2. Write a **paragraph** briefly describing how this module's activities have contributed to progress towards your learning goal - *this is your Reflection* :thought_balloon:
3. If you encountered any problems doing the exercises, you can include how you solved them - this is optional but also encourages you to spend time on *Reflection*  If you're still stuck, seek help in the community forum - see the *Getting help* page in Preparation above!

### Submit your assignment
To submit your assignment, reply to the *Module 1 assignment* topic in our community forum - see below

### Offer feedback to peers
Reply to one or more of the other learners' assignments - *this is your Peer feedback* :speech_balloon:  Your reply should include three elements:
1. **Positive feedback**: What have they done well?
2. **Suggestion or question**: A suggestion for improvement or extending what they've done, or a question if there's something they need to clarify
3. **Reflection**: What you've learned from their work that you can apply to your own?
