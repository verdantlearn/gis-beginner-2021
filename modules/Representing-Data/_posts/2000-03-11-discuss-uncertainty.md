## Uncertainty in your work

Think about your own field data, or spatial data from other sources such as satellite imagery.
- What types of uncertainty exist in them?
- Are these inevitable, i.e. caused by the inability to measure precisely?
- Are they deliberate generalisations or simplifications?
- How might they affect what you can do with these data, for example in your analysis, map-making, or making management recommendations?
- Is there anything you can do to reduce the sources of uncertainty?
