## Uncertainty in your work

Think about your own field data, or spatial data from other sources such as satellite imagery.
- What types of uncertainty exist in them?
- Are these types of uncertainty inevitable, i.e. caused by the difficulty in measuring real-world features precisely?
- Are these types of uncertainty deliberate generalisations or simplifications?
- How might these types of uncertainty affect what you can do with your data, for example in your analysis, map-making, or making management recommendations?
- Is there anything you can do to reduce these sources of uncertainty?
