## Resolution and extent

> Let's add some more technical words to our vocabulary
{: .notice--warning}

### Resolution

Resolution or scale
: The level of detail in the dataset, indicating to the size of the smallest object you can detect

Imagine you have a landscape or piece of art made up of tiles.  You could make much more detailed pictures from tiny mosaic tiles (1cm across) than large flagstones.

High resolution datasets contain a lot of detail within a given area, for example interview data from individual households, or aerial or drone photography on which you might be able to see individual plants or animal sign such as burrows.  Low resolution datasets have lower detail, for example national-level population counts or imagery from early satellites such as Landsat (30m grid cells). 

Also know as grain or frequency.  I prefer the terms 'fine grain' (think silt or sand) to indicate high resolution, and 'coarse grain' (think boulders or pebbles) for low resolution, as I think these phrases are more intuitive and easy to remember

### Extent

Extent
: The extent of a dataset is the area that it covers
: Also know as coverage


These terms apply to all types of data, including both vector and raster

### Spatial *and* temporal 

These terms can be applied to the **temporal dimension** (time) as well as the spatial.  In other words, you can describe a dataset as having high temporal resolution (e.g. repeat observations every hour), or low temporal coverage (e.g. only a single )

Dimension  &nbsp; | Property  &nbsp; | Example of a low value &nbsp; | Example of a high value &nbsp; 
---|---|---
Spatial  | Scale | Single survey location | Entire continent
Spatial | Resolution | One value per country | Submetre grid cells
Temporal | Scale | Single point in time | Spanning multiple decades
Temporal &nbsp; | Resolution &nbsp; | Every decade | Every minute
