## Introduce yourself!
*5 minutes*


Introduce yourself to everyone on VerdantLearn's second GIS refresher course "Combine GPS and field data"!

- Populate your Discourse profile - add a picture
- Create a new topic to introduce yourself - give them ideas about things to say, leave the GIS learning aspirations to a different topic
- Read or search through the topics and - find something you have in common
Take a moment to comment on someone else's post, to say hello and respond to their self-introduction


**Add your location to the map** by clicking on the pink `+` button.  Please include:
- Your name (as the title, by replacing the location name),
- Your current role and organisation


Discourse topic: "Here you can introduce yourself, and meet others interested in ...", plus a repeat of instructions above
