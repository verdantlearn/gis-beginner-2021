### 2.	Objective: Explore and Understand Geospatial Data Models

Geographic Information Systems model the real world with representations of objects such as lakes, roads and towns. Geospatial data models are the means used to represent these features. They are composed to two parts: spatial features and attributes that when combined, create a model of reality.

There are two main geospatial data models: vector and raster. 

*Vector Data Model* – best for modeling discrete objects. Vector data comes in three forms: point, line and polygon.

*Raster Data Model* – this model is best for modeling continuous objects. A raster is composed of a matrix of contiguous cells, with each cell (pixel) holding a single numeric value.
