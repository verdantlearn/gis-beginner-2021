## Choosing an SRS

Theory/comparisons/resources e.g. EPSG


Some questions to consider:
1. What spatial reference system do you use in your fieldwork?  Latitude-Longitude, or a projected coordinate system?
2. Do you know the name of the projection?
3. Do you know which datum that SRS uses?
4. Are all of your spatial datasets in the same SRS?

Now think about why you use that SRS, for example, is it:
- You've been advised to by others more knowledgeable in GIS
- Simplicity of understanding coordinates
- Easier to estimate distances between locations on the ground
- For compatibility with legacy geospatial data such as old survey records
- For compatibility with online data sources
- To allow spatial analysis 


Use <EPSG org?> to find out the EPSG code

Post in the discussion forum:

What spatial reference system and why?  Will you change the SRS you're using based on what you've learned in this module?








*[coordinates]: pair of numbers indicating distance along x and y axes
*[projection]: 
*[datum]: model of the earth's shape
*[SRS]: Spatial Reference System
