## Angular coordinates: Latitude-Longitude

X,Y coordinates underpin all GIS work, as they encode the location information in all geospatial datasets.  Here we explain Latitude-Longitude coordinates, also known as geographical or angular coordinates

Angular coordinates
: The natural way to specify a location on the surface of a sphere is by using **angles**.  Angular coordinates are the difference in *degrees* from a known reference point (0,0) to the location of interest


### Latitude-Longitude
Latitude and longitude are angular coordinates, with a 0,0 reference point where the prime meridian (through Greenwich in London, England) and the equator intersect.  Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam, is located at 21.03&#176;N, 105.85&#176;E, or roughly 21 degrees north of the equator and 105 degrees east of Greenwich

Latitude
: Lines of **latitude** form circles drawn at even intervals around the earth, parallel with the equator.  They are known as **parallels**.  The equator is at 0&#176; latitude, the south pole is at 90&#176;S. The distance between parallels is identical everywhere on the earth's surface: about 111km for every 1 degree of latitude

Longitude
: Lines of **longitude** form semi-circles drawn between the poles, like the segments of an orange or the lines on a basketball.  They are called **meridians**.  The prime meridian is drawn through Greenwich, east London, and other meridians are measured by their angle east or west of the prime meridian, from 180&#176;W (near Hawaii) to 180&#176;E (New Zealand).  Meridians are not parallel; they *converge* at the poles. This means that the straight-line distance between two meridians depends on how close you are to the equator.  For example. 1 degree of longitude is c. 110km at the equator, but only c. 42km at the Antarctic circle (66&#176;30'S).

Note that when you state Latitude-Longitude coordinates, the 'y' coordinate (north/south = Latitude) comes *before* the 'x' coordinate (east/west = Longitude).  This is for historic reasons - the ability to measure latitude from the position of the stars was developed long before people could accurately measure longitude because of the complication of the earth's rotation

*[coordinates]: pair of numbers indicating distance along x and y axes
*[latitude]: north-south angular coordinate measured from equator
*[longitude]: east-west angular coordinate measured from prime meridian
