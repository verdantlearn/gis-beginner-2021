## Introduction
Welcome to Module 3 of 'Introducing GIS for conservation'.  In this module, we focus on how locations are defined in a GIS, enabling us to precisely map the location of real-world objects, and communicate those locations so datasets can be accurately overlaid 

### Learning objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- List the components of a spatial reference system
- Describe the difference between geographic and projected spatial reference systems
- Add point locations to QGIS from a text file
- Set the spatial reference system of a QGIS project
- Reproject a layer
