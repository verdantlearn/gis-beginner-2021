## Extracting data from other layers

One way to extend your field observations is to connect additional information from other GIS layers.  We're going to install a QGIS plugin called `Point sampling tool` to help us efficiently extract data from other layers in our project

### Install a plugin

1. `Plugins` > `Manage and Install Plugins...`
2. Search for *Point sampling tool* under `All`
3. Click on `Install plugin`
4. Close the Plugins dialogue box
