## Add metadata to your map

Maps should always indicate the source of their underlying spatial datasets, and the author and date of creation.  You can also add a title to highlight your message

By the end of this exercise, your map will look something like this:

<center><img style="border: 1px solid" src="{{site.baseurl}}/src/img/Map_Stage5_Metadata.png" alt="Map with metadata added"></center>

<br>


### Title
> 1. Select the `Add Label` tool <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/src/img/QGISTool_AddLabel.png" alt="QGIS Add Label tool"> on the Project toolbar, and click on the map where you want your text box to be.  Click `OK`
2. In the `Item Properties` tab, type in the text of your title, where it says *Lorem ipsum* under `Main Properties`
3. Adjust the font size by clicking on the `Font` dropdown box
4. Experiment with the other settings if you wish, e.g. Horizontal and vertical alignment, 


### Author and date

> 1. Use the `Add Label` tool <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/src/img/QGISTool_AddLabel.png" alt="QGIS Add Label tool"> again to add your name and the date the map was created


### Data sources

By including information on your data sources, you enable your readers to assess their relevance, validity and reliability, and acquire the source data themselves if its publically available

> 1. Add another Label with the `Add Label` tool <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/src/img/QGISTool_AddLabel.png" alt="QGIS Add Label tool"> to provide information on your data sources


### Export your map as an image

Now you have a completed map, you can export it from QGIS for inclusion in reports or as a stand-alone graphic

> 1. In the QGIS `Print Layout` window, go to the `Layout menu > Export as Image`

Amazing work!  :clap:
