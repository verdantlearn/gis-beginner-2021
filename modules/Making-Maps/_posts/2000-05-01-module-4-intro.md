## Introduction
Welcome to Module 4 of 'Introducing GIS for conservation'

This module is very hands-on, working with the details of QGIS' map-making tools.  First, however, you need to decide what you would like your map to show - what story do you want to tell?  What is your message?

### Learning objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Symbolise vector features according to their attributes
- Adjust raster symbology
- List the elements required on a map and explain the purpose of each
- State the message of your map
- Create and export your own map using QGIS
