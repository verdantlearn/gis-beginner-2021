## Introduction
Welcome to Module 4 of 'Introducing GIS for conservation'

This module is very hands-on, working with QGIS' flexible map-making tools.  Before you can make your map, though, you need to decide what you want it to show!  You'll also learn some symbology tricks so you can tell a story with your map

### Learning objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Symbolise vector features according to their attributes
- Adjust raster symbology
- List the elements required on a map and explain the purpose of each
- State the message of your map
- Create and export your own map using QGIS
