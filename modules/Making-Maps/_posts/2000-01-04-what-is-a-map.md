What is a map?



> ```OU``` A **map** is a drawing which represents the real world, but has some
simplification and generalisation imposed in order to clearly convey a
specific message. The spatial relationships of real-world features are
represented accurately, and their relative scale is usually also
apparent. Maps contain specific elements that demonstrate the real-world
location and size of features on the map, plus other specific elements
such as a key or legend, to help readers interpret them. You’ll learn
more about maps in the unit ‘Making maps’. For now, it’s worth being
aware that simple visual representations of real-world objects (for
example, aerial photographs or hand-drawn diagrams to illustrate a
travel route) are not maps, because they lack some of the key elements.
Rather, these are visualisations of the world, and can be the basis for
more formal maps.
