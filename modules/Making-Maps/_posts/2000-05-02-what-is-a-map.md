## What is a map?

Map
: A map is a drawing that represents an area of the world's surface and the spatial relationships of features in that area.  A map is designed to communicate a specific message, by being selective about which features are included, and how they are drawn.  Maps include all the information required for readers to interpret the map's message, and relate features on the map back to their real-world counterparts  


### Purpose of a map
What is the purpose of a map?

This definition of a map reveals an important and perhaps startling and important feature of maps - they deliberately lie!  In order to communicate a message, you deliberately withold or obscure some information, and emphasise a particular dataset or map feature to focus your reader's attention on what you're trying to communicate.

<!-- Connect to previous - simplification/generalisation, uncertainty in some aspects as a consequence of clarity in your message -->


<!-- ### Examples

Same map with different or contradictory messages: 
- Gibbons are fine - many sightings spread across park
- Gibbons are not fine - smaller groups near forest edge, ?problem in disturbed areas?

> ```OU``` A **map** is a drawing which represents the real world, but has some
simplification and generalisation imposed in order to clearly convey a
specific message. The spatial relationships of real-world features are
represented accurately, and their relative scale is usually also
apparent. Maps contain specific elements that demonstrate the real-world
location and size of features on the map, plus other specific elements
such as a key or legend, to help readers interpret them. You’ll learn
more about maps in the unit ‘Making maps’. For now, it’s worth being
aware that simple visual representations of real-world objects (for
example, aerial photographs or hand-drawn diagrams to illustrate a
travel route) are not maps, because they lack some of the key elements.
Rather, these are visualisations of the world, and can be the basis for
more formal maps.
