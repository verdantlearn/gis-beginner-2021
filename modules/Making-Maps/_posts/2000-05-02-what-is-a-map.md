## What is a map?

Map
: A map is a drawing that represents an area of the world's surface, and the spatial relationships and attributes of features in that area.  Maps include all the information required for readers to *interpret* the map's message, and to relate features on the map back to their real-world counterparts

: In contrast, simple visual representations of real-world objects (aerial photographs or sketches) are not maps, because they lack components needed to locate or interpret the features they display.  They can however provide the basis for a formal map

: A map is designed to communicate a specific message.  This is done through being selective about which features are included, and how they are drawn.  Features which tell the **story** are emphasised through symbology to focus the reader's attention on your message.  Features which obscure or distract from the message are excluded

This definition of a map reveals an important and perhaps startling feature of maps - their selective focus on a particular message requires them to *deliberately lie*!  :astonished:  In the words of cartographer and geographer Mark Monmonier[^1]:

> "Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it’s essential.  To portray meaningful relationships for a complex, three-dimensional world on a flat sheet of paper or a video screen, a map must distort reality.  As a scale model, the map must use symbols that almost always are proportionally much bigger or thicker than the features they represent.  To avoid hiding critical information in a fog of detail, the map must offer a selective, incomplete view of reality.  There’s no escape from the cartographic paradox: to present a useful and truthful picture, an accurate map must tell white lies." *(page 1)*

In addition, Monmonier stresses that: 
> "...authors can freely experiment with features, measurements, area of coverage, and symbols and can pick the map that best presents their case or supports their unconscious bias’ *(page 2)*

Same map with different or contradictory messages: 
- Gibbons are fine - many sightings spread across park
- Gibbons are not fine - smaller groups near forest edge, ?problem in disturbed areas?
