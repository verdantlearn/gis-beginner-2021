Congratulations!  You've learned enough about QGIS over the last four modules to create and style your own map!  Fabulous work :fireworks:

Before you submit your final assignment, reflect on where you are in your GIS learning journey 

## Reflect on your progress

Take a few minutes to **reflect** on what you've learned this week
1. What is the *most useful* thing you've learned so far?
2. What is your biggest *remaining question* at this point?
