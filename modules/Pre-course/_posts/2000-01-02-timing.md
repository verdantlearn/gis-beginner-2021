## Flexible learning

This GIS refresher course *Combine GPS and field data* will run for five days, from Monday 17th to Friday 21st May 2021

The learning activities should take you 3-4 hours of effort spread over five days of the course, depending on how rusty your GIS skills are and how much detail you want to go into

- The **timing** of most activities is *flexible*, so you can choose when to study
- Tasks are arranged by day; you can spend 30-45min every day Monday to Friday, or you could complete all the activities in a single morning or afternoon
- We recommend that you **spread your learning** over several days, so that you can benefit from input and feedback from other participants, but it's your choice!
- The only activities that are timetabled are two **live sessions** (Zoom video calls), on *Monday* and *Friday*.  These calls are offered at two different times (*09:30 BST* or *15:30 BST* = London time) to maximise your chance to attend.  If you're not able to join because of other commitments, that's fine - just contribute to the shared collaborative documents when you can.  See the learning materials on Monday and Friday for the Zoom link
